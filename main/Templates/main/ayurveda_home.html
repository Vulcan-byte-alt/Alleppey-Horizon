Following the session, the patient undergoes a warm water bath or is toweled off. This treatment, tailored to the individual's needs, aims to alleviate fatigue, enhance memory, restore balance, and is beneficial for conditions like insomnia, migraine, ear and nose diseases, spondylitis, and paraplegia.</p>
